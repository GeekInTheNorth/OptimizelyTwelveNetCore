# Optimizely 12

Optimizely (Formerly EPiServer) is a CMS platform that has historically been built on the .NET 4.x tech stack.  With the move to Optimizely 12, the technical stack is moving to .NET 5.0.  As part of this, the way that components are built is changing.  This solution is a test bed for my own learning.
